# Pharmacy Claims Data Warehousing - ALY 6030

## Project Overview
This repository documents the transformation of raw pharmacy claims data into a structured, relational database. Adhering to Third Normal Form (3NF) principles and employing a star schema, this project aims to streamline pharmacy claims data management for improved efficiency and analytical insight.

## Process Summary
- **Normalization**: Transformed raw data into 3NF, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.
- **Star Schema Design**: Implemented a star schema in MySQL for efficient querying and data analysis, with a central fact table and surrounding dimension tables.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Carefully designated to maintain data integrity and establish relationships within the database.
- **SQL Queries**: Crafted to extract meaningful insights on prescription patterns, demographic distributions, and insurance payments.

## Key Components
- `Normalization Details`: Steps taken to achieve 1NF, 2NF, and finally 3NF, ensuring a robust data structure.
- `Star Schema`: Explanation of the schema's layout, including the central fact table and dimension tables.
- `Primary and Foreign Key Setup`: SQL scripts used to define primary and foreign keys within the database.
- `Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)`: Visual representation of the database structure, illustrating the relationships between tables.
- `Analytical Queries`: Examples of SQL queries designed to answer critical business questions about pharmacy claims.
